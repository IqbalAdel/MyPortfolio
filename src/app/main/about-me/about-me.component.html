        <p data-translate-key="me-txt">Hi, I am a Front-end deverloper based in Frankfurt, Germany and I developed an interest in programming through entry level courses in university. Gradually, I realised my passion when working on front-end projects during the training at the Developer Academy. <br> <br> While I continued polishing my skills with established web-dev technologies I slowly built up my portfolio that is showcased here. Please have a look!</p>

                <p data-translate-key="point1">One of the favourite things I love about working as a front-end developer is that you can develop your own ideas, limited only by your own imaginations and then implement those ideas in reality through code while getting instant visual feedback on your work and the value that you have created.</p>

                <p data-translate-key="point2">To me, time passes by really quickly while I code and every problem I solve feels like another puzzle piece that finds itself in its rightful place. Typically, the satisfaction when solving a puzzle is the greatest when the problem has been especially tricky to handle.</p>
